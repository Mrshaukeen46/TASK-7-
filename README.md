# 🧩 Task 7: Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions

## 🎯 Objective
To enhance browser security by identifying, analyzing, and removing suspicious or malicious extensions that may compromise user privacy or system integrity.

## 🧠 Overview
Browser extensions improve user experience but can also introduce security risks if developed by untrusted sources. Malicious extensions may collect personal data, inject ads, or redirect users to phishing websites. This task focused on reviewing installed browser extensions, evaluating their permissions and behavior, and removing any that posed potential threats.
